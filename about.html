            <p>Hi, my name is SAME. I'm a music producer and mixing engineer.</p>
            <p>Originally starting as a drummer and moving on to becoming a music producer I was able to help tons of great artists doing their first steps and getting closer to their goal.</p>
            <p>I've worked in all kinds of genres, However, I specialize Reggaet√≥n, Pop, and Rap music.</p>
            <p>Generally, I work with artists who are in the process of launching or growing their career in music. So if your goal is to develop a signature sound, build a fan base, and garner industry attention then I want to help strengthen your platform by turning your demos into awesome songs. I'm based in Germany, but I work with artists remotely all over the world.</p>
            <p>I can help you in every stage, from writing and producing to mixing or mastering. If you want your awesome songs to be even cooler: Let's talk!</p>
